<darcy-dialogue> I certainly shall not.
<darcy-dialogue> You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner.
<darcy-dialogue> At such an assembly as this, it would be insupportable.
<darcy-dialogue> Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.
<darcy-dialogue> _You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room.
<darcy-dialogue> She is tolerable: but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men.
<darcy-dialogue> You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.
<darcy-dialogue> With great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic.
<darcy-dialogue> Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance.
<darcy-dialogue> It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.
<darcy-dialogue> You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.
<darcy-dialogue> Never, sir.
<darcy-dialogue> I should imagine not.
<darcy-dialogue> My mind was more agreeably engaged.
<darcy-dialogue> I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.
<darcy-dialogue> Miss Elizabeth Bennet.
<darcy-dialogue> That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask.
<darcy-dialogue> A lady’s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony, in a moment.
<darcy-dialogue> I knew you would be wishing me joy.
<darcy-dialogue> Certainly not.
<darcy-dialogue> Not at all, they were brightened by the exercise.
<darcy-dialogue> But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world.
<darcy-dialogue> It ought to be good; it has been the work of many generations.
<darcy-dialogue> I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these.
<darcy-dialogue> Your list of the common extent of accomplishments has too much truth.
<darcy-dialogue> The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen; but I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.
<darcy-dialogue> I cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished.
<darcy-dialogue> Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.
<darcy-dialogue> All this she must possess, and to all she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading.
<darcy-dialogue> Undoubtedly, there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation.
<darcy-dialogue> Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable.
<darcy-dialogue> The country can in general supply but few subjects for such a study.
<darcy-dialogue> In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society.
<darcy-dialogue> I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love.
<darcy-dialogue> You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.
<darcy-dialogue> I have already told her so once, by your desire.
<darcy-dialogue> It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.
<darcy-dialogue> Thank you--but I always mend my own.
<darcy-dialogue> Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?
<darcy-dialogue> At present I have not room to do them justice.
<darcy-dialogue> They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me to determine.
<darcy-dialogue> My style of writing is very different from yours.
<darcy-dialogue> Nothing is more deceitful than the appearance of humility.
<darcy-dialogue> It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast.
<darcy-dialogue> The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting.
<darcy-dialogue> The power of doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance.
<darcy-dialogue> When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning, that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself; and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?
<darcy-dialogue> I daresay you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity.
<darcy-dialogue> Your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had better stay till next week,’ you would probably do it--you would probably not go--and, at another word, might stay a month.
<darcy-dialogue> You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged.
<darcy-dialogue> Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety.
<darcy-dialogue> To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either.
<darcy-dialogue> Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?
<darcy-dialogue> I see your design, Bingley.
<darcy-dialogue> You dislike an argument, and want to silence this.
<darcy-dialogue> Do you not feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?
<darcy-dialogue> Indeed I do not dare.
<darcy-dialogue> Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?
<darcy-dialogue> This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the avenue.
<darcy-dialogue> I have not the smallest objection to explaining them.
<darcy-dialogue> You either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other’s confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking: if the first, I should be completely in your way; and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire.
<darcy-dialogue> Miss Bingley has given me credit for more than can be. The wisest and best of men,--nay, the wisest and best of their actions,--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke.
<darcy-dialogue> Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule.
<darcy-dialogue> Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real superiority of mind--pride will be always under good regulation.
<darcy-dialogue> No, I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding.
<darcy-dialogue> My temper I dare not vouch for. It is, I believe, too little yielding; certainly too little for the convenience of the world.
<darcy-dialogue> I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself.
<darcy-dialogue> My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them.
<darcy-dialogue> My temper would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost is lost for ever.
<darcy-dialogue> There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.
<darcy-dialogue> And yours is wilfully to misunderstand them.
<darcy-dialogue> Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?
<darcy-dialogue> Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?
<darcy-dialogue> This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure.
<darcy-dialogue> How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say.
<darcy-dialogue> _You_ think it a faithful portrait, undoubtedly.
<darcy-dialogue> Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his _making_ friends; whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them, is less certain.
<darcy-dialogue> Sir William’s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of.
<darcy-dialogue> What think you of books?
<darcy-dialogue> I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject.
<darcy-dialogue> We may compare our different opinions.
<darcy-dialogue> I am.
<darcy-dialogue> I hope not.
<darcy-dialogue> May I ask to what these questions tend?
<darcy-dialogue> And what is your success?
<darcy-dialogue> I can readily believe that reports may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.
<darcy-dialogue> I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours.
<darcy-dialogue> The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?
<darcy-dialogue> I assure you, madam, that she does not need such advice. She practises very constantly.
<darcy-dialogue> I shall not say that you are mistaken, because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which, in fact, are not your own.
<darcy-dialogue> I am not afraid of you.
<darcy-dialogue> Perhaps I should have judged better had I sought an introduction, but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.
<darcy-dialogue> I certainly have not the talent which some people possess, of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.
<darcy-dialogue> I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done.
<darcy-dialogue> You are perfectly right.
<darcy-dialogue> You have employed your time much better.
<darcy-dialogue> No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting.
<darcy-dialogue> We neither of us perform to strangers.
<darcy-dialogue> Perfectly so, I thank you.
<darcy-dialogue> I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future.
<darcy-dialogue> He has many friends, and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing.
<darcy-dialogue> I should not be surprised if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers.
<darcy-dialogue> This seems a very comfortable house.
<darcy-dialogue> Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford.
<darcy-dialogue> Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife.
<darcy-dialogue> It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends.
<darcy-dialogue> And what is fifty miles of good road?
<darcy-dialogue> Little more than half a day’s journey.
<darcy-dialogue> Yes, I call it a very easy distance.
<darcy-dialogue> It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire.
<darcy-dialogue> Anything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.
<darcy-dialogue> You cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment.
<darcy-dialogue> You cannot have been always at Longbourn.
<darcy-dialogue> Are you pleased with Kent?
<darcy-dialogue> In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed.
<darcy-dialogue> You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.
<darcy-dialogue> And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!
<darcy-dialogue> I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little endeavour at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.
<darcy-dialogue> I have no wish of denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success.
<darcy-dialogue> Towards him I have been kinder than towards myself.
<darcy-dialogue> You take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns.
<darcy-dialogue> His misfortunes! Yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed.
<darcy-dialogue> This is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me!
<darcy-dialogue> I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed!
<darcy-dialogue> Perhaps these offences might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design.
<darcy-dialogue> These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by everything.
<darcy-dialogue> But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just.
<darcy-dialogue> Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?
<darcy-dialogue> You have said quite enough, madam.
<darcy-dialogue> I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.
<darcy-dialogue> Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness.
<darcy-dialogue> I have been walking in the grove some time, in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?
<darcy-dialogue> Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to you.
<darcy-dialogue> I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.
<darcy-dialogue> You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I demand it of your justice.
<darcy-dialogue> Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.
<darcy-dialogue> The first mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr.
<darcy-dialogue> Bingley from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham.
<darcy-dialogue> Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.
<darcy-dialogue> But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read.
<darcy-dialogue> If, in the explanation of them which is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry.
<darcy-dialogue> The necessity must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.
<darcy-dialogue> I had not been long in Hertfordshire before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country.
<darcy-dialogue> But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment.
<darcy-dialogue> I had often seen him in love before.
<darcy-dialogue> At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas’s accidental information, that Bingley’s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.
<darcy-dialogue> He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided.
<darcy-dialogue> From that moment I observed my friend’s behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him.
<darcy-dialogue> Your sister I also watched.
<darcy-dialogue> Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard; and I remained convinced, from the evening’s scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment.
<darcy-dialogue> If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have been in an error.
<darcy-dialogue> Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable.
<darcy-dialogue> If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable.
<darcy-dialogue> But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister’s countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.
<darcy-dialogue> That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain; but I will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears.
<darcy-dialogue> I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.
<darcy-dialogue> My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me.
<darcy-dialogue> But there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before me.
<darcy-dialogue> These causes must be stated, though briefly.
<darcy-dialogue> The situation of your mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father:--pardon me,--it pains me to offend you.
<darcy-dialogue> But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both.
<darcy-dialogue> I will only say, farther, that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection.
<darcy-dialogue> He left Netherfield for London on the day following, as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.
<darcy-dialogue> The part which I acted is now to be explained.
<darcy-dialogue> His sisters’ uneasiness had been equally excited with my own: our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London.
<darcy-dialogue> We accordingly went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice.
<darcy-dialogue> I described and enforced them earnestly.
<darcy-dialogue> But however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance, which I hesitated not in giving, of your sister’s indifference.
<darcy-dialogue> He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal, regard.
<darcy-dialogue> But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own.
<darcy-dialogue> To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point.
<darcy-dialogue> To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment.
<darcy-dialogue> I cannot blame myself for having done thus much.
<darcy-dialogue> There is but one part of my conduct, in the whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister’s being in town.
<darcy-dialogue> I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it.
<darcy-dialogue> That they might have met without ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger.
<darcy-dialogue> Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.
<darcy-dialogue> It is done, however, and it was done for the best.
<darcy-dialogue> On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer.
<darcy-dialogue> If I have wounded your sister’s feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn them.
<darcy-dialogue> With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family.
<darcy-dialogue> Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.
<darcy-dialogue> Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed.
<darcy-dialogue> My father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridge; most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman’s education.
<darcy-dialogue> My father was not only fond of this young man’s society, whose manners were always engaging, he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.
<darcy-dialogue> As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner.
<darcy-dialogue> The vicious propensities, the want of principle, which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have.
<darcy-dialogue> Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell.
<darcy-dialogue> But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character.
<darcy-dialogue> It adds even another motive.
<darcy-dialogue> My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr.
<darcy-dialogue> Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant.
<darcy-dialogue> There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.
<darcy-dialogue> His own father did not long survive mine; and within half a year from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be benefited.
<darcy-dialogue> He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein.
<darcy-dialogue> I rather wished than believed him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal.
<darcy-dialogue> I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman.
<darcy-dialogue> The business was therefore soon settled.
<darcy-dialogue> He resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds.
<darcy-dialogue> All connection between us seemed now dissolved.
<darcy-dialogue> I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town.
<darcy-dialogue> In town, I believe, he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence; and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.
<darcy-dialogue> For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the presentation.
<darcy-dialogue> His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad.
<darcy-dialogue> He had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions.
<darcy-dialogue> You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.
<darcy-dialogue> His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself.
<darcy-dialogue> After this period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped.
<darcy-dialogue> How he lived, I know not.
<darcy-dialogue> But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.
<darcy-dialogue> I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being.
<darcy-dialogue> Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy.
<darcy-dialogue> My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother’s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.
<darcy-dialogue> About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs.
<darcy-dialogue> Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement.
<darcy-dialogue> She was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to herself.
<darcy-dialogue> I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement; and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me.
<darcy-dialogue> You may imagine what I felt and how I acted.
<darcy-dialogue> Regard for my sister’s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs.
<darcy-dialogue> Younge was of course removed from her charge.
<darcy-dialogue> Mr. Wickham’s chief object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement.
<darcy-dialogue> His revenge would have been complete indeed.
<darcy-dialogue> This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham.
<darcy-dialogue> I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood, he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at, ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either.
<darcy-dialogue> Detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination.
<darcy-dialogue> You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night.
<darcy-dialogue> But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.
<darcy-dialogue> For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of the executors of my father’s will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions.
<darcy-dialogue> If your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning.
<darcy-dialogue> I will only add, God bless you.
<darcy-dialogue> Good day, Miss Bennet.
<darcy-dialogue> I trust you are well?
<darcy-dialogue> They will join me early to-morrow, and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.
<darcy-dialogue> Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?
<darcy-dialogue> Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?
<darcy-dialogue> I perceive no other alteration than her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.
<darcy-dialogue> Yes, but _that_ was only when I first knew her; for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.
<darcy-dialogue> Good God! what is the matter?
<darcy-dialogue> I will not detain you a minute; but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner.
<darcy-dialogue> You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself.
<darcy-dialogue> Let me call your maid.
<darcy-dialogue> Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief?
<darcy-dialogue> A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.
<darcy-dialogue> I am grieved, indeed; grieved—shocked.
<darcy-dialogue> But is it certain, absolutely certain?
<darcy-dialogue> And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?
<darcy-dialogue> I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing concern.
<darcy-dialogue> Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part, that might offer consolation to such distress!
<darcy-dialogue> But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.
<darcy-dialogue> This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister’s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.
<darcy-dialogue> I am sorry, exceedingly sorry, that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness.
<darcy-dialogue> If you _will_ thank me, let it be for yourself alone.
<darcy-dialogue> That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny.
<darcy-dialogue> But your _family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought only of _you_.
<darcy-dialogue> You are too generous to trifle with me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once.
<darcy-dialogue> _My_ affections and wishes are unchanged; but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever.
<darcy-dialogue> It taught me to hope, as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before.
<darcy-dialogue> I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine frankly and openly.
<darcy-dialogue> What did you say of me that I did not deserve?
<darcy-dialogue> For though your accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof.
<darcy-dialogue> It was unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.
<darcy-dialogue> I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.
<darcy-dialogue> The recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me.
<darcy-dialogue> Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: ‘Had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.’
<darcy-dialogue> Those were your words.
<darcy-dialogue> You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.
<darcy-dialogue> I can easily believe it.
<darcy-dialogue> You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure you did.
<darcy-dialogue> The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me.
<darcy-dialogue> Did it, did it _soon_ make you think better of me?
<darcy-dialogue> Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?
<darcy-dialogue> I knew that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary.
<darcy-dialogue> I hope you have destroyed the letter.
<darcy-dialogue> There was one part, especially the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading again.
<darcy-dialogue> I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me.
<darcy-dialogue> When I wrote that letter, I believed myself perfectly calm and cool; but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.
<darcy-dialogue> I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of ignorance.
<darcy-dialogue> But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled.
<darcy-dialogue> I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.
<darcy-dialogue> As a child I was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper.
<darcy-dialogue> I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.
<darcy-dialogue> Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoiled by my parents, who, though good themselves, (my father particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own.
<darcy-dialogue> Such I was, from eight to eight-and-twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you!
<darcy-dialogue> You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.
<darcy-dialogue> By you, I was properly humbled.
<darcy-dialogue> I came to you without a doubt of my reception.
<darcy-dialogue> You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.
<darcy-dialogue> Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses.
<darcy-dialogue> My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure you.
<darcy-dialogue> I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong.
<darcy-dialogue> How you must have hated me after that evening!
<darcy-dialogue> Hate you! I was angry, perhaps, at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction.
<darcy-dialogue> No, indeed, I felt nothing but surprise.
<darcy-dialogue> My object _then_ was to show you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to.
<darcy-dialogue> How soon any other wishes introduced themselves, I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you.
<darcy-dialogue> Not at all.
<darcy-dialogue> When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.
<darcy-dialogue> On the evening before my going to London, I made a confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago.
<darcy-dialogue> I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent.
<darcy-dialogue> His surprise was great.
<darcy-dialogue> He had never had the slightest suspicion.
<darcy-dialogue> I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.
<darcy-dialogue> From the former.
<darcy-dialogue> I had narrowly observed her, during the two visits which I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection.
<darcy-dialogue> It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest.
<darcy-dialogue> His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine made everything easy.
<darcy-dialogue> I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him.
<darcy-dialogue> I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him.
<darcy-dialogue> He was angry.
<darcy-dialogue> But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister’s sentiments.
<darcy-dialogue> He has heartily forgiven me now.
<darcy-dialogue> Go to your father; he wants you in the library.
<darcy-dialogue> I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago.
<darcy-dialogue> I was in the middle before I knew that I _had_ begun.
<darcy-dialogue> For the liveliness of your mind I did.
<darcy-dialogue> Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was ill at Netherfield?
<darcy-dialogue> Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.
<darcy-dialogue> And so was I.
<darcy-dialogue> A man who had felt less might.
<darcy-dialogue> You need not distress yourself.
<darcy-dialogue> The moral will be perfectly fair.
<darcy-dialogue> Lady Catherine’s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts.
<darcy-dialogue> I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude.
<darcy-dialogue> I was not in a humour to wait for an opening of yours. My aunt’s intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know everything.
<darcy-dialogue> My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I might ever hope to make you love me.
<darcy-dialogue> My avowed one, or what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister was still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.
<darcy-dialogue> I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth.
<darcy-dialogue> But it ought to be done; and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly.
