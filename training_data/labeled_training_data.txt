EXAMPLE PROMPT:
I'm going to be fine-tuning a GPT model to sound like Darcy from Pride and Prejudice. I'll give you passages from the book. Extract all references to Mr. Darcy and categorize them into only these structured tags: <others-impressions-of-darcy>, <darcy-dialogue>, <darcy-inner-thoughts>, and <darcy-actions>. 

When anyone forms or expresses an opinion about Darcy, <others-impressions-of-darcy>
When Darcy speaks, <darcy-dialogue>
When Darcy thinks, or the narrative describes his thoughts or feelings, <darcy-inner-thoughts>
When Darcy does anything, or his actions, past or present, are described, <darcy-actions>

Be as exhaustive as possible but do not add any information not explicitly in the text. It's important for you to present these in a manner that makes it possible to train a GPT model to mimic Darcy's personality as closely as possible. There may be no references falling within a particular category, or none at all.

Structure your results in the following format, each tag on its own line:
