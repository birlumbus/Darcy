EXAMPLE PROMPT:
I'm going to be fine-tuning a GPT model to sound like Darcy from Pride and Prejudice. Here is a passage from the book. Extract all references to Mr. Darcy and categorize them into structured tags like <others-impressions-of-darcy>, <darcy-background>, <darcy-dialogue>, <darcy-inner-thoughts>, <darcy-actions>, and <darcy-relationships>. Be as exhaustive as possible but do not add any information not explicitly in the text. It's important for you to present these in a manner that makes it possible to train a GPT model to mimic Darcy's personality as closely as possible.

Structure your results in the following format:
<darcy-background> Large estate in Derbyshire
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Not all his large estate in Derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.

Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: he had a pleasant
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,
with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely
looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and
the report, which was in general circulation within five minutes after
his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was
much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his
large estate in Derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding,
disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his
friend.
