<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley.
<darcy-actions> He declined being introduced to any other lady.
<darcy-actions> He spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for Elizabeth to overhear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley.
<darcy-dialogue> I certainly shall not.
<darcy-dialogue> You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner.
<darcy-dialogue> At such an assembly as this, it would be insupportable.
<darcy-dialogue> Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.
<darcy-dialogue> _You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room.
<darcy-dialogue> She is tolerable: but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men.
<darcy-dialogue> You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till, catching her eye, he withdrew his own.
<darcy-actions> Darcy thought Elizabeth not handsome enough to overcome his dislike of dancing with someone he doesn't know.
<darcy-actions> He sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy did not dance with Eliza.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy remained silent for half an hour while sitting next to Mrs. Long.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy answered Mrs. Long’s question, but seemed angry at being bothered.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.
<darcy-actions> No sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.
<darcy-actions> In spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness.
<darcy-actions> He began to wish to know more of Elizabeth after observing her more closely.
<darcy-actions> He attended to her conversation with others as a step towards conversing with her himself.
<darcy-dialogue> With great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening.
<darcy-actions> He was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour.
<darcy-dialogue> Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance.
<darcy-dialogue> It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.
<darcy-dialogue> You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.
<darcy-dialogue> Never, sir.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy bowed when Sir William asked if he had a house in town.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive Elizabeth’s hand.
<darcy-actions> He requested to be allowed the honour of her hand, but was refused.
<darcy-actions> He was thinking of her with some complacency.
<darcy-dialogue> My mind was more agreeably engaged.
<darcy-dialogue> I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.
<darcy-dialogue> Miss Elizabeth Bennet.
<darcy-dialogue> That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask.
<darcy-dialogue> A lady’s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony, in a moment.
<darcy-dialogue> I knew you would be wishing me joy.
<darcy-actions> Darcy went with Bingley to dine with the officers.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy said very little.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone.
<darcy-dialogue> Certainly not.
<darcy-dialogue> Not at all, they were brightened by the exercise.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy replied with composure to Miss Bingley's teasing.
<darcy-dialogue> But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world.
<darcy-dialogue> It ought to be good; it has been the work of many generations.
<darcy-dialogue> I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy replied with a sense of pride about his family’s library.
<darcy-dialogue> Your list of the common extent of accomplishments has too much truth.
<darcy-dialogue> The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen; but I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.
<darcy-dialogue> I cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished.
<darcy-dialogue> Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.
<darcy-dialogue> All this she must possess, and to all she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading.
<darcy-dialogue> Undoubtedly, there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation.
<darcy-dialogue> Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable.
<darcy-dialogue> The country can in general supply but few subjects for such a study.
<darcy-dialogue> In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society.
<darcy-actions> Darcy spoke in response to Bingley's remark about the study of character.
<darcy-actions> Darcy turned silently away after looking at Mrs. Bennet.
<darcy-dialogue> I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love.
<darcy-actions> Darcy only smiled.
<darcy-actions> Darcy could not be provoked to conversation by Miss Bingley's witticisms on "fine eyes."
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy spent the morning writing letters.
<darcy-actions> Darcy did not choose to reply to Miss Bingley's comment on his penmanship.
<darcy-dialogue> You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.
<darcy-dialogue> I have already told her so once, by your desire.
<darcy-dialogue> It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.
<darcy-dialogue> Thank you--but I always mend my own.
<darcy-dialogue> Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?
<darcy-dialogue> At present I have not room to do them justice.
<darcy-dialogue> They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me to determine.
<darcy-dialogue> My style of writing is very different from yours.
<darcy-dialogue> Nothing is more deceitful than the appearance of humility.
<darcy-dialogue> It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast.
<darcy-dialogue> The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting.
<darcy-dialogue> The power of doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance.
<darcy-dialogue> When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning, that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself; and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?
<darcy-dialogue> I daresay you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity.
<darcy-dialogue> Your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had better stay till next week,’ you would probably do it--you would probably not go--and, at another word, might stay a month.
<darcy-dialogue> You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged.
<darcy-dialogue> Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety.
<darcy-dialogue> To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either.
<darcy-dialogue> Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?
<darcy-dialogue> I see your design, Bingley.
<darcy-dialogue> You dislike an argument, and want to silence this.
<darcy-dialogue> Do you not feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?
<darcy-dialogue> Indeed I do not dare.
<darcy-dialogue> Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy smiled, concealing his offense.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy drew near Elizabeth before speaking to her.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy’s eyes were frequently fixed on Elizabeth.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy believed he was bewitched by Elizabeth.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness.
<darcy-dialogue> This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the avenue.
<darcy-actions> Darcy addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet with a polite congratulation.
<darcy-actions> Darcy took up a book.
<darcy-actions> Darcy merely answered her question and read on.
<darcy-actions> Darcy looked up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book.
<darcy-actions> He was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere.
<darcy-actions> He offered the requested explanation as soon as she allowed him to speak.
<darcy-dialogue> I have not the smallest objection to explaining them.
<darcy-dialogue> You either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other’s confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking: if the first, I should be completely in your way; and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire.
<darcy-actions> Darcy spoke with a smile when amused.
<darcy-actions> Darcy, after a few moments’ recollection, was not sorry to end his conversation.
<darcy-actions> He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.
<darcy-dialogue> Miss Bingley has given me credit for more than can be. The wisest and best of men,--nay, the wisest and best of their actions,--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke.
<darcy-dialogue> Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule.
<darcy-dialogue> Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real superiority of mind--pride will be always under good regulation.
<darcy-dialogue> No, I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding.
<darcy-dialogue> My temper I dare not vouch for. It is, I believe, too little yielding; certainly too little for the convenience of the world.
<darcy-dialogue> I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself.
<darcy-dialogue> My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them.
<darcy-dialogue> My temper would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost is lost for ever.
<darcy-dialogue> There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.
<darcy-dialogue> And yours is wilfully to misunderstand them.
<darcy-actions> To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence: Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked.
<darcy-actions> He resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him.
<darcy-actions> Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday.
<darcy-actions> Though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.
<darcy-actions> During a chance meeting, Mr. Darcy was determined not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth.
<darcy-actions> Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street.
<darcy-actions> Darcy turned red at the chance sighting of Wickham.
<darcy-actions> Darcy directly approached Elizabeth to make polite inquiries.
<darcy-actions> Darcy applied for her hand in dance, surprising her.
<darcy-actions> After applying for Elizabeth's hand in the next dance, he walked away again immediately.
<darcy-actions> Darcy smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said.
<darcy-actions> Darcy asked Elizabeth if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton.
<darcy-actions> Darcy's features showed a deeper shade of hauteur when Elizabeth mentioned Wickham.
<darcy-actions> Darcy spoke in a constrained manner when replying about Wickham's manners.
<darcy-dialogue> Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?
<darcy-dialogue> Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?
<darcy-dialogue> This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure.
<darcy-dialogue> How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say.
<darcy-dialogue> _You_ think it a faithful portrait, undoubtedly.
<darcy-dialogue> Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his _making_ friends; whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them, is less certain.
<darcy-actions> Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.
<darcy-actions> Darcy's eyes were directed, with a very serious expression, towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together.
<darcy-actions> Darcy, recovering himself shortly, turned to his partner.
<darcy-actions> In Darcy's breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling toward Elizabeth, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another.
<darcy-dialogue> Sir William’s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of.
<darcy-dialogue> What think you of books?
<darcy-dialogue> I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject.
<darcy-dialogue> We may compare our different opinions.
<darcy-dialogue> I am.
<darcy-dialogue> I hope not.
<darcy-dialogue> May I ask to what these questions tend?
<darcy-dialogue> And what is your success?
<darcy-dialogue> I can readily believe that reports may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.
<darcy-dialogue> I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours.
<darcy-dialogue> The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy's astonishment at being so addressed was very evident.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy was eyeing Mr. Collins with unrestrained wonder.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy replied with an air of distant civility.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of Mr. Collins’ second speech.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy made Mr. Collins a slight bow, and moved another way.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with Mr. Collins' attention.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy sat opposite to them, overhearing Mrs. Bennet's impertinent words.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy's attention was invariably fixed by Mrs. Bennet's impertinent commentary.
<darcy-actions> The expression of Mr. Darcy's face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy continued impenetrably grave.
<darcy-actions> Though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, Mr. Darcy never came near enough to speak.
<darcy-actions> Darcy said nothing at all.
<darcy-actions> The united efforts of Bingley's two unfeeling sisters, and of his overpowering friend Mr. Darcy, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy’s house was where Bingley stayed.
<darcy-actions> Caroline wrote also with great pleasure of her brother’s being an inmate of Mr. Darcy’s house, and mentioned with raptures some Darcy's plans with regard to new furniture.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy’s actions attempted to lead Bingley away from his affection for Jane.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy’s influence was seen as a key factor in Bingley’s behavior.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy would not suffer Bingley to call on Jane during her stay in London.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs. Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend, met her with every appearance of composure.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy sat for some time without speaking to anybody.
<darcy-actions> His civility was awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family.
<darcy-actions> She thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet in London.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt’s ill-breeding, and made no answer.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister’s proficiency.
<darcy-actions> Elizabeth and Colonel Fitzwilliam conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy.
<darcy-dialogue> I assure you, madam, that she does not need such advice. She practises very constantly.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy moved with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte, stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer’s countenance.
<darcy-actions> He smiled as he spoke to Elizabeth.
<darcy-dialogue> I shall not say that you are mistaken, because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which, in fact, are not your own.
<darcy-dialogue> I am not afraid of you.
<darcy-dialogue> Perhaps I should have judged better had I sought an introduction, but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.
<darcy-dialogue> I certainly have not the talent which some people possess, of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.
<darcy-dialogue> I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done.
<darcy-dialogue> You are perfectly right.
<darcy-dialogue> You have employed your time much better.
<darcy-dialogue> No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting.
<darcy-dialogue> We neither of us perform to strangers.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy paid the parsonage a visit on his own, after Elizabeth's cheeky suggestion to practice the art of conversation.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy seemed astonished on finding her alone.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy apologized for his intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth sat down.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy took the hint and soon began the conversation.
<darcy-dialogue> Perfectly so, I thank you.
<darcy-dialogue> I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future.
<darcy-dialogue> He has many friends, and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing.
<darcy-dialogue> I should not be surprised if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers.
<darcy-dialogue> This seems a very comfortable house.
<darcy-dialogue> Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford.
<darcy-dialogue> Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife.
<darcy-dialogue> It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends.
<darcy-dialogue> And what is fifty miles of good road?
<darcy-dialogue> Little more than half a day’s journey.
<darcy-dialogue> Yes, I call it a very easy distance.
<darcy-dialogue> It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire.
<darcy-dialogue> Anything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards Elizabeth.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and glanced over it.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy sat without saying much to anybody before leaving.
<darcy-actions> Darcy engaged in a short conversation, pleasantries about the local area.
<darcy-actions> Darcy appeared often at the parsonage.
<darcy-dialogue> You cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment.
<darcy-dialogue> You cannot have been always at Longbourn.
<darcy-dialogue> Are you pleased with Kent?
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy frequently sat at the Parsonage ten minutes together without opening his lips.
<darcy-actions> More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy.
<darcy-actions> It struck her in the course of their third encounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s happiness.
<darcy-actions> In speaking of Rosings, and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there too.
<darcy-actions> He actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy was concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy had ruined, for a while, every hope of happiness for Jane.
<darcy-actions> Elizabeth was surprised when she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room.
<darcy-actions> In a hurried manner, Mr. Darcy immediately began an inquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.
<darcy-actions> He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up, walked about the room.
<darcy-actions> After a silence of several minutes, Mr. Darcy came towards her in an agitated manner.
<darcy-dialogue> In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed.
<darcy-dialogue> You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.
<darcy-actions> He caught Elizabeth's refusal with surprise and resentment.
<darcy-actions> His complexion became pale with anger, the disturbance of his mind visible in every feature.
<darcy-actions> He struggled for the appearance of composure, not opening his lips until he believed himself to have attained it.
<darcy-actions> He spoke with a voice of forced calmness.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy expressed his hope that his attachment would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand.
<darcy-actions> He spoke of his apprehension and anxiety in approaching Elizabeth to propose.
<darcy-actions> He caught Elizabeth's refusal with surprise and resentment.
<darcy-actions> His complexion became pale with anger, the disturbance of his mind visible in every feature.
<darcy-actions> He struggled for the appearance of composure, not opening his lips until he believed himself to have attained it.
<darcy-actions> He spoke with a voice of forced calmness.
<darcy-actions> He leant on the mantel-piece.
<darcy-dialogue> And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!
<darcy-dialogue> I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little endeavour at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy changed colour.
<darcy-actions> He listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued.
<darcy-actions> He looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.
<darcy-dialogue> I have no wish of denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success.
<darcy-dialogue> Towards him I have been kinder than towards myself.
<darcy-dialogue> You take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns.
<darcy-dialogue> His misfortunes! Yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed.
<darcy-actions> Darcy walked with quick steps across the room.
<darcy-dialogue> This is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me!
<darcy-dialogue> I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed!
<darcy-dialogue> Perhaps these offences might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design.
<darcy-dialogue> These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by everything.
<darcy-dialogue> But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just.
<darcy-dialogue> Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?
<darcy-dialogue> You have said quite enough, madam.
<darcy-dialogue> I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.
<darcy-dialogue> Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness.
<darcy-actions> He hastily left the room.
<darcy-actions> Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy stepped forward with eagerness.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy held out a letter, which Elizabeth instinctively took.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy writes in a close hand.
<darcy-actions> Darcy wrote his letter to Elizabeth covering two sheets of letter paper.
<darcy-dialogue> I have been walking in the grove some time, in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?
<darcy-dialogue> Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to you.
<darcy-dialogue> I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.
<darcy-dialogue> You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I demand it of your justice.
<darcy-dialogue> Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.
<darcy-dialogue> The first mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr.
<darcy-dialogue> Bingley from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr.
<darcy-dialogue> Wickham.
<darcy-dialogue> Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.
<darcy-dialogue> But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read.
<darcy-dialogue> If, in the explanation of them which is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry.
<darcy-dialogue> The necessity must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.
<darcy-dialogue> I had not been long in Hertfordshire before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country.
<darcy-dialogue> But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment.
<darcy-dialogue> I had often seen him in love before.
<darcy-dialogue> At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas’s accidental information, that Bingley’s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.
<darcy-dialogue> He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided.
<darcy-dialogue> From that moment I observed my friend’s behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him.
<darcy-dialogue> Your sister I also watched.
<darcy-dialogue> Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard; and I remained convinced, from the evening’s scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment.
<darcy-dialogue> If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have been in an error.
<darcy-dialogue> Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable.
<darcy-dialogue> If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable.
<darcy-dialogue> But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister’s countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.
<darcy-dialogue> That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain; but I will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears.
<darcy-dialogue> I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.
<darcy-dialogue> My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me.
<darcy-dialogue> But there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before me.
<darcy-dialogue> These causes must be stated, though briefly.
<darcy-dialogue> The situation of your mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father:--pardon me,--it pains me to offend you.
<darcy-dialogue> But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both.
<darcy-dialogue> I will only say, farther, that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection.
<darcy-dialogue> He left Netherfield for London on the day following, as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.
<darcy-dialogue> The part which I acted is now to be explained.
<darcy-dialogue> His sisters’ uneasiness had been equally excited with my own: our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London.
<darcy-dialogue> We accordingly went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice.
<darcy-dialogue> I described and enforced them earnestly.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> I have never liked him
<darcy-dialogue> But however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance, which I hesitated not in giving, of your sister’s indifference.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy’s reserve and lack of proper consideration were the reasons his actions had been misunderstood.
<darcy-dialogue> He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal, regard.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in having such a master.
<darcy-dialogue> But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long.
<darcy-dialogue> To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> The good lady who showed them the house gave Mr. Darcy a most flaming character.
<darcy-dialogue> To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mrs. Bennet talked of Mrs. Darcy with delighted pride.
<darcy-dialogue> I cannot blame myself for having done thus much.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mrs. Bennet fancied she had gained a complete victory over Mr. Darcy.
<darcy-dialogue> There is but one part of my conduct, in the whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister’s being in town.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, approached them soon afterwards.
<darcy-dialogue> I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Yes, very handsome.
<darcy-dialogue> That they might have met without ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> She was convinced that she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they should meet.
<darcy-dialogue> Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> His father was an excellent man.
<darcy-dialogue> It is done, however, and it was done for the best.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Lady Catherine is concerned that Darcy’s sister could be “polluted” by the Bennet family connection.
<darcy-dialogue> On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Darcy will be just like him--just as affable to the poor.
<darcy-dialogue> If I have wounded your sister’s feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured Mr.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth: How could I ever think Lady Catherine like her nephew Darcy?
<darcy-dialogue> Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy's pride would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend’s connections than from their want of sense.
<darcy-dialogue> Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Lady Catherine believes that a connection with Elizabeth would disgrace Darcy in the eyes of everybody.
<darcy-dialogue> Mr.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy was described as exceedingly handsome and conceited.
<darcy-dialogue> Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth was delighted. In Darcy's home she had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste.
<darcy-dialogue> My father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridge; most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman’s education.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Darcy was haughty, reserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.
<darcy-dialogue> My father was not only fond of this young man’s society, whose manners were always engaging, he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy’s pride was partly governed by his desire to retain Mr. Bingley for his sister.
<darcy-dialogue> As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!
<darcy-dialogue> The vicious propensities, the want of principle, which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> His manners are very different from his cousin’s.
<darcy-dialogue> Darcy could not have.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Darcy was so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now.
<darcy-dialogue> Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own.
<darcy-dialogue> But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy treated the mention of Mr. Wickham's misfortunes with contempt and ridicule.
<darcy-dialogue> Wickham has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy’s character was to speak for itself.
<darcy-dialogue> It adds even another motive.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy's influence is the primary reason for Jane's unhappiness.
<darcy-dialogue> My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Reynolds respect for Darcy is such that her estimation of Elizabeth rises simply on discovery that Darcy knows her.
<darcy-dialogue> Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Darcy's improvement of manners had outlived one day.
<darcy-dialogue> There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face.
<darcy-dialogue> His own father did not long survive mine; and within half a year from these events Mr.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame.
<darcy-dialogue> Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be benefited.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Before learning the truth about Wickham, Mr. Darcy’s character sunk on every review of it.
<darcy-dialogue> He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Lady Catherine wants Mr. Darcy to marry her daughter.
<darcy-dialogue> I rather wished than believed him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Darcy inspired in Georgiana a respect which almost overcame her affection.
<darcy-dialogue> I knew that Mr.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy's behaviour, so strikingly altered.
<darcy-dialogue> Wickham ought not to be a clergyman.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Bennet becomes convinced Mr. Darcy deserves Elizabeth.
<darcy-dialogue> The business was therefore soon settled.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> At that instant she felt, that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion.
<darcy-dialogue> He resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy's expression changed from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity.
<darcy-dialogue> All connection between us seemed now dissolved.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Conjectures about his prensence at Lydia's wedding that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, still seemed most improbable.
<darcy-dialogue> I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth felt flattered and pleased by Darcy’s wish to introduce his sister to her, considering it a compliment of the highest kind.
<darcy-dialogue> In town, I believe, he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence; and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy looked at Elizabeth a great deal, but the expression was disputable.
<darcy-dialogue> For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the presentation.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Bennet soon assured her that Mr. Darcy was rising every hour in his esteem.
<darcy-dialogue> His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> There was no fault to find with him, as far as their acquaintance reached.
<darcy-dialogue> He had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Gardiner was surprised by Darcy’s attentiveness, stating that there was no necessity for such attention given the trivial nature of his acquaintance with Elizabeth.
<darcy-dialogue> You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour, should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a right to be proud.
<darcy-dialogue> His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mrs. Gardiner noted that there was something stately about Darcy, but she didn’t find it unbecoming.
<darcy-dialogue> After this period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy was generous in imputing the blame to his mistaken pride.
<darcy-dialogue> How he lived, I know not.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards.
<darcy-dialogue> But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> He never said a great deal.
<darcy-dialogue> I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Not all his large estate in Derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance.
<darcy-dialogue> Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Everybody says that he is eat up with pride.
<darcy-dialogue> My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother’s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her.
<darcy-dialogue> About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> She was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.
<darcy-dialogue> Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Lady Catherine talked of Mr. Darcy's coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and Elizabeth.
<darcy-dialogue> Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> He is the best landlord, and the best master, that ever lived. Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but themselves.
<darcy-dialogue> She was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to herself.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> His pride does not offend me so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it.
<darcy-dialogue> I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement; and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.
<darcy-dialogue> You may imagine what I felt and how I acted.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth did not detect any enthusiasm from Darcy about the idea of his marrying Miss de Bourgh.
<darcy-dialogue> Regard for my sister’s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Darcy seemed to think the country was nothing at all.
<darcy-dialogue> Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy’s pride would be wounded by his friend's connections not having importance.
<darcy-dialogue> Younge was of course removed from her charge.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mrs. Gardiner was visibly surprised at Darcy’s civility.
<darcy-dialogue> Mr.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient; but Darcy was clever.
<darcy-dialogue> Wickham’s chief object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> As she read his account of Mr. Wickham, Elizabeth experienced astonishment, apprehension, and even horror.
<darcy-dialogue> His revenge would have been complete indeed.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Darcy was overflowing with admiration.
<darcy-dialogue> This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Collins reported that Mr. Darcy appeared to be in very good health and in tolerable spirits after leaving Rosings.
<darcy-dialogue> Wickham.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth’s uncle and aunt, in their amazement, felt that the attention from Mr. Darcy could only be explained by a partiality for their niece.
<darcy-dialogue> I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood, he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at, ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> The compliment to herself and her sister in Mr. Darcy’s letter was soothing but could not console her for the contempt attracted by the rest of her family.
<darcy-dialogue> Detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw anything of it.
<darcy-dialogue> You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Miss Bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy’s progress through his book, as in reading her own.
<darcy-dialogue> But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy is perceived as a man of gallantry and respect, particularly when interacting with Elizabeth.
<darcy-dialogue> For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of the executors of my father’s will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man.
<darcy-dialogue> If your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance.
<darcy-dialogue> I will only add, God bless you.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth realized Darcy was right about the behavior of her family.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy gave Elizabeth a letter.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth could see his countenance expressed security for her acceptance to his proposal.
<darcy-actions> He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied Elizabeth; his style seemed at first not penitent, but haughty.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy is aware of and reacts to the rudeness of others, particularly in social situations.
<darcy-actions> He provided an account of his objections to the match between Jane and Bingley.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth felt her uncle and aunt had misunderstood Darcy’s character but refrained from correcting them.
<darcy-actions> He detailed his history with Mr. Wickham, including Wickham’s dealings with the Pemberley family and the matter of the living.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy may, perhaps, have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month’s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy had called only for a few minutes to take leave.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> His composure convinced her that all was safe.
<darcy-actions> Darcy left Rosings the day after giving Elizabeth his letter
<others-impressions-of-darcy> His attachment excited gratitude.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy has not authorized the communication of his sister’s affairs.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> An union that must have been to the advantage of both: by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved; and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy's letter was not to be disclosed to others.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well.
<darcy-actions> Elizabeth stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Implacable resentment _is_ a shade in Mr. Darcy.
<darcy-actions> Elizabeth thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth's feelings towards him were at times widely different.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth felt that Darcy’s actions were a significant departure from his previous conduct.
<darcy-actions> He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings.
<darcy-actions> He shortly recovered himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy's feelings toward Elizabeth are influenced by her perceived social inferiority.
<darcy-actions> He provided his compliments to Elizabeth, though she had turned away instinctively in embarassment.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth’s misery increased at such unnecessary, such officious attention!
<darcy-actions> At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and after standing a few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings.
<darcy-dialogue> Good day, Miss Bennet.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizebeth saw that Darcy would consider Collins' interruption unwelcome.
<darcy-dialogue> I trust you are well?
<others-impressions-of-darcy> She was proud of him,--proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy approached them, and at no great distance.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> It was a well-known fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.
<darcy-actions> He was immediately before them after a turning in the walk.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> He was as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy had lost none of his recent civility.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley was incomprehensible.
<darcy-actions> He asked Elizabeth if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy bowed to corroborated the report of their being on the way to check on Jane's health.
<darcy-actions> He sustained his surprise with fortitude and did not leave, but turned back with them and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Every line of his letter proved more clearly that his conduct, which she had believed infamous, was capable of a turn that made him entirely blameless.
<darcy-actions> He invited Mr. Gardiner to fish there as often as he chose, offering to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out the best parts of the stream for sport.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mrs. Bennet thought Darcy was tiresome for always coming to visit.
<darcy-actions> He acknowledged the truth of Mrs. Gardiner’s statement regarding his arrival and explained that business with his steward had caused him to come earlier than expected.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> It was not to be supposed that there were much affection in Mr. Darcy's interference.
<darcy-actions> He mentioned that his party would join him early the next day, and among them were Mr. Bingley and his sisters.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth, who knew her mother's rudeness to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat.
<darcy-actions> He offered to introduce his sister to Mrs. Gardiner’s acquaintance during their stay at Lambton.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> He is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him.
<darcy-dialogue> They will join me early to-morrow, and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mrs. Gardiner assumed Mr. Darcy was a liberal master, and that, in the eye of a servant, comprehended every virtue.
<darcy-dialogue> Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Lady Catherine believed that Darcy’s attachment to Rosings was increasing.
<darcy-actions> Darcy asked Elizabeth to walk into the house, but she declared herself not tired, so they stood together on the lawn.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy seemed to speak out of necessity, not choice.
<darcy-actions> Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage when it was time to depart.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitude.
<darcy-actions> Darcy walked slowly towards the house after the Gardner's carriage drove off.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> It is evident that you belong to the first circles.
<darcy-dialogue> Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?
<others-impressions-of-darcy> With his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.
<darcy-actions> Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and the introduction took place.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy’s pride and caprice were the cause of Jane’s suffering.
<darcy-actions> Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Darcy determined to be pleased.
<darcy-actions> Darcy asked her whether all her sisters were at Longbourn.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Miss Bingley was persuaded that Darcy admired Elizabeth.
<darcy-actions> Darcy sought the acquaintance and courted the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Darcy's actions, though kind, appeared to be influenced by his focus on Elizabeth rather than the family.
<darcy-actions> Darcy appeared civil, not only to Elizabeth, but to her very relations whom he had openly disdained.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> His conduct was cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend.
<darcy-actions> It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far removed from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Miss Bingley admired Mr. Darcy’s collection of books at Pemberley.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy discharged many of Wickham's debts.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth could not bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy seemed eager to preserve the acquaintance with Elizabeth, soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> She had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling.
<darcy-actions> Darcy entered the room after being with Mr. Gardiner and other gentlemen by the river.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth regarded Mr. Darcy with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as what Jane felt for Bingley.
<darcy-actions> Darcy was earnestly looking at Elizabeth while she spoke, with a heightened complexion.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> His affection was proved to have been sincere.
<darcy-actions> Darcy was concerned about his sister’s welfare and attempted to manage the situation with Elizabeth.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Miss Bennet’s astonishment at Darcy's proposal was only lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> I believe it does not often happen that he or any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts.
<darcy-actions> Darcy returned to the saloon.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy is perceived as someone who values logic and structure over yielding to persuasion without reason.
<darcy-actions> Darcy contented himself with coolly replying.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth saw that Darcy was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded, as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.
<darcy-dialogue> I perceive no other alteration than her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Lady Catherine: From his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin.
<darcy-dialogue> Yes, but _that_ was only when I first knew her; for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth had no fear of the news spreading farther through Mr. Darcy's means. There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy’s judgment could not err; and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> He could not, in her mother’s presence, be what he was before her uncle and aunt.
<darcy-actions> Darcy was resolutely silent, however, and, from a determination of making him speak, Miss Bingley continued.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy had boundless influence over Mr. Bingley.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy appeared as Elizabeth reached the door.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> A man who has once been refused! How could she ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love?
<darcy-actions> Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy seems very angry at being spoken to.
<darcy-actions> Before he could recover himself enough to speak, Elizabeth hastily exclaimed her need to leave.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> She envied everyone to whom he spoke.
<darcy-actions> Darcy, seeing Elizabeth’s distress, responded with more feeling than politeness.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mrs. Bennet’s dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters.
<darcy-actions> He quickly recollected himself and offered assistance, suggesting that he or a servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy is the judge of Mr. Bingley’s inclination, and directs how his friend is to be happy.
<darcy-actions> Seeing Elizabeth looking miserably ill, he found it impossible to leave her.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mrs. Bennet: "Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley’s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him."
<darcy-actions> He spoke in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, offering to call her maid or bring her a glass of wine.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mrs. Bennet: "that tall, proud man"
<darcy-dialogue> Good God! what is the matter?
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Had his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world.
<darcy-dialogue> I will not detain you a minute; but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy would not suffer Bingley to call on Jane in such a part of London.
<darcy-dialogue> You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth replied with tears in her eyes, affirming her love for Mr. Darcy.
<darcy-dialogue> Let me call your maid.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> It was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.
<darcy-dialogue> Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief?
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy's attention to Jane rekindled the admiration of her former lover.
<darcy-dialogue> A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy's pride is described as the worst kind of pride.
<darcy-actions> Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern and observe Elizabeth in compassionate silence.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew.
<darcy-actions> Darcy was fixed in astonishment upon hearing the news of Lydia’s elopement.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> His words seemed to imply marriage. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts?
<darcy-dialogue> I am grieved, indeed; grieved—shocked.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Bingley had the firmest reliance on Darcy’s regard, and the highest opinion of his judgment.
<darcy-dialogue> But is it certain, absolutely certain?
<others-impressions-of-darcy> To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men.
<darcy-dialogue> And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mrs. Gardiner thought she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.
<darcy-actions> Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy never stirs without his friend Bingley.
<darcy-actions> Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth’s astonishment grew at Darcy’s change in behaviour, speculating that it could not possibly be for her sake that his manners had softened.
<darcy-actions> He was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air gloomy.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride.
<darcy-dialogue> I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing concern.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth was disappointed at Darcy's not speaking to her the week of Jane's proposal, and angry with herself for being so.
<darcy-dialogue> Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part, that might offer consolation to such distress!
<others-impressions-of-darcy> It was evident that he was very much in love with her.
<darcy-dialogue> But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name.
<darcy-dialogue> This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister’s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Everybody was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had known anything of Wickham's account.
<darcy-actions> Darcy readily assured Elizabeth of his secrecy.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Her astonishment at his coming--at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire.
<darcy-actions> He again expressed his sorrow for her distress.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the report of his having ten thousand a year.
<darcy-actions> He wished for a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth was amazed that Mr. Darcy believed any apology to be in his power.
<darcy-actions> He left his compliments for her relations.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> To Elizabeth it appeared that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed.
<darcy-actions> With only one serious parting look, he went away.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy had been at Lydia's wedding.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mrs. Collins could not understand Mr. Darcy's behavior.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy called and was shut up with Mr. Gardiner for several hours.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where Lydia and Mr. Wickham were and had seen them both.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> She was steadfastly persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy had something to direct his search and resolved to follow Mr. Gardiner.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy went to Mrs. Younge for intelligence about Wickham and, after a few days, obtained the information.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> He has been accused of many faults at different times; but this is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy insisted on seeing Lydia after seeing Wickham.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy is seen as someone who can be easily influenced by a woman's charm and wit.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy asked Lydia to leave her disgraceful situation and return to her friends, offering his assistance.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy asked Mr. Gardiner why Wickham did not marry Lydia at once.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, everything to him.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy purchased Wickham’s commission.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Lady Catherine observed that Darcy seemed to feel the departure from Rosings most acutely, even more than the previous year.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy returned to his friends after the arrangements were resolved and agreed to be in London for the wedding.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> His disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return and attended the wedding.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth believed that during their dance it would be greater punishment to force Darcy to speak than to remain silent.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy dined with Mr. Gardiner's family the next day and was to leave town a few days later.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth assured her father of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.
<darcy-actions> He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> His account of the objections to the match made Elizabeth too angry to wish to do him justice.
<darcy-actions> I thought him very sly; he hardly ever mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Even Mr. Darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Darcy's astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.
<darcy-actions> He was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mrs. Philips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley’s good-humour encouraged.
<darcy-actions> Darcy introduced Elizabeth to his sister.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> He had a very satirical eye.
<darcy-actions> Elizabeth had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at Pemberley.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy is always buying books.
<darcy-actions> Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, said scarcely anything.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while.
<darcy-actions> He was not seated by her: perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy does not yield easily, particularly without a strong rationale.
<darcy-actions> Several minutes elapsed, without bringing the sound of his voice.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy is very far from agreeing with the estimation of ladies' accomplishments in general.
<darcy-actions> When occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mrs. Bennet referred to Mr. Darcy as "that disagreeable Mr. Darcy."
<darcy-actions> More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when they last met, were plainly expressed.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy’s behaviour was pleasing in every respect, as it had been in Derbyshire.
<darcy-actions> After Bingley finished his visit, Darcy left with him.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth initially found Mr. Darcy’s explanation insufficient but, upon rereading, found his assertions credible.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy was almost as far from Elizabeth as the table could divide them.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy likes to have his own way very well.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy was on one side of her mother, and they spoke seldom to each other.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing.
<darcy-actions> Their manner was formal and cold whenever Mr. Darcy and her mother spoke to each other.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mrs. Bennet felt a strong resentment toward Mr. Darcy, wishing her husband had been present to "give him one of your set-downs."
<darcy-actions> Darcy had walked away to another part of the room.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy sends the Gardiners all the love in the world that can be spared from me.
<darcy-actions> Darcy brought back his coffee-cup himself.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mrs. Gardiner noted Mr. Darcy had a pleasing look when he spoke, and something dignified about his countenance that would not give one an unfavorable idea of his heart.
<darcy-actions> Darcy stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> You will not find him favourably spoken of by anyone.
<darcy-actions> Darcy walked away when the young lady whispered to Elizabeth again.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy writes with study and deliberation.
<darcy-actions> Darcy was seated with the rest of the party.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mrs. Bennet, luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion.
<darcy-actions> Darcy held his secrecy. His aunt knows nothing of his involvement in Lydia's elopement.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy’s gaze appeared earnest but sometimes seemed like an absence of mind.
<darcy-actions> Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?
<darcy-actions> Very little was said by either; Darcy was likely preoccupied or silent during the walk.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> If he wished to converse with her, he might have better success.
<darcy-actions> Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy entertained each other while walking.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy suggests the limited variety of a country neighbourhood.
<darcy-actions> Elizabeth went boldly on with Darcy alone after Kitty left them.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Everybody hoped that he would never come there again.
<darcy-actions> Darcy replied in a tone of surprise and emotion at discovering Elizabeth knew of his having found Wickham and Lydia.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before. I hope he will overlook it.
<darcy-actions> Darcy did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted with his secret.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth confessed that she loved Darcy better than Bingley.
<darcy-actions> Darcy acknowledged that his actions were influenced by the desire to give happiness to Elizabeth.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> “I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,” said Mr. Bennet. “Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well as Jane’s.”
<darcy-dialogue> I am sorry, exceedingly sorry, that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the gate.
<darcy-dialogue> If you _will_ thank me, let it be for yourself alone.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all.
<darcy-dialogue> That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy’s conduct does not suit Elizabeth’s feelings.
<darcy-dialogue> But your _family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought only of _you_.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> At first, his belief in Jane’s insensibility to Bingley she instantly resolved to be false.
<darcy-dialogue> You are too generous to trifle with me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Among his own connections he was esteemed and valued.
<darcy-dialogue> _My_ affections and wishes are unchanged; but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.
<darcy-actions> He expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth secretly formed a desperate resolution, possibly in response to Darcy's actions or demeanor.
<darcy-actions> He told her of feelings which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Miss Bingley believed Mr. Darcy neglected nothing that could add to the beauties of Pemberley.
<darcy-actions> Elizabeth soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter, which, in her Ladyship’s apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance. This caused Darcy's return.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy’s behaviour astonished and vexed Elizabeth.
<darcy-dialogue> It taught me to hope, as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her Ladyship than she could do.
<darcy-dialogue> I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine frankly and openly.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Lady Catherine: The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy, they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of his mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles we planned the union.
<darcy-dialogue> What did you say of me that I did not deserve?
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy's pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer.
<darcy-dialogue> For though your accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Gardner left in perlexity at Darcy's not having communicated with Elizabeth. He believed they must be more intimately connected than they appeared.
<darcy-dialogue> It was unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> His being so sure of succeeding was wrong, said she, and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment.
<darcy-dialogue> I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth: "I do, I do like him. I love him. Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable."
<darcy-dialogue> The recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth felt there was no one whose knowledge of a sister’s frailty would have mortified her so much as Mr. Darcy.
<darcy-dialogue> Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: ‘Had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.’
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor.
<darcy-dialogue> Those were your words.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy was considered disagreeable and horrid by Mrs. Bennet.
<darcy-dialogue> You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy was considered fastidious in his taste for dance partners.
<darcy-dialogue> I can easily believe it.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned.
<darcy-dialogue> You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure you did.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> He is certainly a good brother.
<darcy-dialogue> The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> It was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, in addition to all other objections, there was an alliance with the man whom he so justly scorned.
<darcy-dialogue> Did it, did it _soon_ make you think better of me?
<others-impressions-of-darcy> It was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room.
<darcy-dialogue> Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?
<others-impressions-of-darcy> He was unworthy to be compared with his friend.
<darcy-dialogue> I knew that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!
<darcy-dialogue> I hope you have destroyed the letter.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> The wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine.
<darcy-dialogue> There was one part, especially the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading again.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy is viewed as a man whose attention is often caught by Elizabeth’s personality and demeanor.
<darcy-dialogue> I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.
<darcy-dialogue> When I wrote that letter, I believed myself perfectly calm and cool; but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mrs. Gardiner believed Darcy's motivation to be partially that of helping Elizabeth.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy believed the letter to be written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Lady Catherine: I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.
<darcy-dialogue> I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of ignorance.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> His general character excited respect.
<darcy-dialogue> But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> The justice of Mr. Darcy’s charge regarding her family’s impropriety struck Elizabeth too forcibly for denial.
<darcy-dialogue> I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mrs. Reynolds had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.
<darcy-dialogue> As a child I was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> He was discovered to be proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased.
<darcy-dialogue> I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> The testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, had produced a friendlier nature in her towards him.
<darcy-dialogue> Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoiled by my parents, who, though good themselves, (my father particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> They had nothing to accuse him of but pride.
<darcy-dialogue> Such I was, from eight to eight-and-twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you!
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in anything.
<darcy-dialogue> You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Darcy did not comment further on the country after Mrs. Bennet's remarks.
<darcy-dialogue> By you, I was properly humbled.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> When Elizabeth remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation, until she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him.
<darcy-dialogue> I came to you without a doubt of my reception.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> She found his style to be all pride and insolence.
<darcy-dialogue> You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> In essentials, I believe, he is very much what he ever was.
<darcy-dialogue> Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> He was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening.
<darcy-dialogue> My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure you.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> After Wickham's account in Meryton, Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.
<darcy-dialogue> I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance—an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways—seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust—anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits.
<darcy-dialogue> How you must have hated me after that evening!
<others-impressions-of-darcy> His walking with Elizabeth seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance.
<darcy-actions> Darcy believed himself to have been selfish all his life, though not in principle.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine,--with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.
<darcy-actions> Darcy admitted that his parents allowed, encouraged, and even taught him to be selfish and overbearing.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world.
<darcy-actions> Darcy acknowledged that he came to Elizabeth without a doubt of his reception.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mrs. Gardiner should be sorry to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.
<darcy-actions> Darcy thought he might still have been selfish had it not been for Elizabeth.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> They could not be untouched by his politeness.
<darcy-actions> Darcy believed his vanity led him to think Elizabeth was wishing for or expecting his addresses.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mrs. Gardiner thought Mr. Darcy could not have behaved in such a cruel way to Wickham.
<darcy-dialogue> Hate you! I was angry, perhaps, at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance.
<darcy-dialogue> No, indeed, I felt nothing but surprise.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth: “I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way.”
<darcy-dialogue> My object _then_ was to show you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth thought of Mr. Darcy’s civility and his wish for her to be acquainted with his sister.
<darcy-dialogue> How soon any other wishes introduced themselves, I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old.
<darcy-actions> He then told her of Georgiana’s delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> The ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley.
<darcy-actions> Darcy's gravity and thoughtfulness had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy was considered high and self-important, walking around as if he fancied himself to be very great.
<darcy-dialogue> Not at all.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light.
<darcy-dialogue> When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy enjoys the power of doing what he likes.
<darcy-dialogue> On the evening before my going to London, I made a confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his life! It is admirable!
<darcy-dialogue> I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> I do remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition must be dreadful.
<darcy-dialogue> His surprise was great.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy is seen as someone who expects the highest standards of conviction and deliberation.
<darcy-dialogue> He had never had the slightest suspicion.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been gladly and gratefully received!
<darcy-dialogue> I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Miss Bennet had nothing further to wish when convinced of Elizabeth's attachment to Darcy.
<darcy-dialogue> From the former.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy’s indifference was considered as something to be laughed at by Mr. Bennet, but not by Elizabeth.
<darcy-dialogue> I had narrowly observed her, during the two visits which I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> He listened to her with perfect indifference.
<darcy-dialogue> It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too much.
<darcy-dialogue> His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine made everything easy.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Wickham professed himself willing to see Darcy, but proved the coward in the end.
<darcy-dialogue> I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of Elizabeth.
<darcy-dialogue> I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> It seemed to Elizabeth that Darcy had boasted of making Jane miserable by "saving" Bingley from a disadvantageous marriage.
<darcy-dialogue> He was angry.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth was sorry that she had made Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister.
<darcy-dialogue> But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister’s sentiments.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were surprised by Darcy’s civility, pronouncing him to be infinitely superior to what they had expected.
<darcy-dialogue> He has heartily forgiven me now.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy seldom appeared really animated.
<darcy-actions> Darcy continued the conversation till they reached the house.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy was regarded as cold and dismissive, especially after his comment about Elizabeth.
<darcy-actions> In the hall, Darcy parted from Elizabeth.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare.
<darcy-actions> Darcy was delighted with Jane and Bingley's engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Miss Bingley thought Mr. Darcy would not wish to see his sister make such an exhibition.
<darcy-actions> Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Darcy was continually giving offence.
<darcy-actions> Darcy arrived again with Bingley on the day after his engagement to Elizabeth.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy is severe upon the arts which ladies sometimes use for captivation.
<darcy-actions> Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, in order to see Elizabeth alone.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy’s objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend.
<darcy-actions> Darcy rose and followed Mr. Bennet to the library.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that Bingley and Jane's engagement must have taken place with Darcy's concurrence.
<darcy-actions> Darcy appeared again and smiled at Elizabeth, slightly relieving her agitation.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> He was always the sweetest tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the world.
<darcy-actions> Darcy approached the table where Elizabeth was sitting with Kitty, pretending to admire her work.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature.
<darcy-dialogue> Go to your father; he wants you in the library.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> His manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity.
<darcy-actions> Darcy voluntarily helped Lydia by paying the debts and securing the commission.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> I am sure _I_ know none so handsome.
<darcy-dialogue> I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth was perfectly aware that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia’s infamy somewhat better.
<darcy-dialogue> I was in the middle before I knew that I _had_ begun.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him.
<darcy-dialogue> For the liveliness of your mind I did.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth felt gratified by Darcy’s actions, interpreting the civility as a compliment for herself.
<darcy-dialogue> Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was ill at Netherfield?
<others-impressions-of-darcy> As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people’s happiness were in his guardianship!
<darcy-dialogue> Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy’s actions have caused lasting harm to Jane’s happiness.
<darcy-dialogue> And so was I.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> He was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating.
<darcy-dialogue> A man who had felt less might.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Whatever can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment. There is nothing he would not do for her.
<darcy-dialogue> You need not distress yourself.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> She and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.
<darcy-dialogue> The moral will be perfectly fair.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy’s conduct was seen as officious in separating Mr. Bingley and Jane.
<darcy-dialogue> Lady Catherine’s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Elizabeth concluded that Darcy’s actions were the work of his brotherly desire for Miss Darcy to be acquainted with her, and it reassured her that his resentment hadn’t caused him to think ill of her.
<darcy-dialogue> I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy.
<darcy-dialogue> I was not in a humour to wait for an opening of yours. My aunt’s intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know everything.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> I am so pleased--so happy. Such a charming man! so handsome! so tall!
<darcy-dialogue> My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I might ever hope to make you love me.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mrs. Bennet hoped Elizabeth would not mind having Mr. Darcy all to herself.
<darcy-dialogue> My avowed one, or what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister was still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> On slight acquaintance he is thought to be an ill-tempered man.
<darcy-actions> Darcy returned to Netherfield to advise his friend to marry Jane, if he perceived her regard was undiminished
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Jane was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister’s refusal must have given him.
<darcy-actions> Darcy returned to Netherfield primarily with the object of seeing Elizabeth.
<others-impressions-of-darcy> Mr. Darcy is excessively glad to find that George Wickham had taken himself out of the way.
<darcy-dialogue> I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth.
<darcy-dialogue> But it ought to be done; and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly.
<darcy-actions> Darcy writes a letter to his aunt, informing her of his engagement.
<darcy-actions> He bore Mrs. Bennet's behavior with admirable calmness.
<darcy-actions> He could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James’s, with very decent composure.
<darcy-actions> If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.
<darcy-actions> Mrs. Philips’s vulgarity was another, and, perhaps, a greater tax on his forbearance.
<darcy-actions> Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification.
<darcy-actions> Darcy assisted Wickham further in his profession for Elizabeth’s sake.
<darcy-actions> Darcy had hoped to see the attachment of Elizabeth to his sister.
<darcy-actions> Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved the Gardiners.
