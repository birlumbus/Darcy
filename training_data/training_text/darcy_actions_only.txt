<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley.
<darcy-actions> He declined being introduced to any other lady.
<darcy-actions> He spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for Elizabeth to overhear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till, catching her eye, he withdrew his own.
<darcy-actions> Darcy thought Elizabeth not handsome enough to overcome his dislike of dancing with someone he doesn't know.
<darcy-actions> He sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy did not dance with Eliza.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy remained silent for half an hour while sitting next to Mrs. Long.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy answered Mrs. Long’s question, but seemed angry at being bothered.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.
<darcy-actions> No sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.
<darcy-actions> In spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness.
<darcy-actions> He began to wish to know more of Elizabeth after observing her more closely.
<darcy-actions> He attended to her conversation with others as a step towards conversing with her himself.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening.
<darcy-actions> He was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy bowed when Sir William asked if he had a house in town.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive Elizabeth’s hand.
<darcy-actions> He requested to be allowed the honour of her hand, but was refused.
<darcy-actions> He was thinking of her with some complacency.
<darcy-actions> Darcy went with Bingley to dine with the officers.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy said very little.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy replied with composure to Miss Bingley's teasing.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy replied with a sense of pride about his family’s library.
<darcy-actions> Darcy spoke in response to Bingley's remark about the study of character.
<darcy-actions> Darcy turned silently away after looking at Mrs. Bennet.
<darcy-actions> Darcy only smiled.
<darcy-actions> Darcy could not be provoked to conversation by Miss Bingley's witticisms on "fine eyes."
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy spent the morning writing letters.
<darcy-actions> Darcy did not choose to reply to Miss Bingley's comment on his penmanship.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy smiled, concealing his offense.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy drew near Elizabeth before speaking to her.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy’s eyes were frequently fixed on Elizabeth.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy believed he was bewitched by Elizabeth.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness.
<darcy-actions> Darcy addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet with a polite congratulation.
<darcy-actions> Darcy took up a book.
<darcy-actions> Darcy merely answered her question and read on.
<darcy-actions> Darcy looked up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book.
<darcy-actions> He was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere.
<darcy-actions> He offered the requested explanation as soon as she allowed him to speak.
<darcy-actions> Darcy spoke with a smile when amused.
<darcy-actions> Darcy, after a few moments’ recollection, was not sorry to end his conversation.
<darcy-actions> He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.
<darcy-actions> To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence: Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked.
<darcy-actions> He resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him.
<darcy-actions> Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday.
<darcy-actions> Though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.
<darcy-actions> During a chance meeting, Mr. Darcy was determined not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth.
<darcy-actions> Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street.
<darcy-actions> Darcy turned red at the chance sighting of Wickham.
<darcy-actions> Darcy directly approached Elizabeth to make polite inquiries.
<darcy-actions> Darcy applied for her hand in dance, surprising her.
<darcy-actions> After applying for Elizabeth's hand in the next dance, he walked away again immediately.
<darcy-actions> Darcy smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said.
<darcy-actions> Darcy asked Elizabeth if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton.
<darcy-actions> Darcy's features showed a deeper shade of hauteur when Elizabeth mentioned Wickham.
<darcy-actions> Darcy spoke in a constrained manner when replying about Wickham's manners.
<darcy-actions> Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.
<darcy-actions> Darcy's eyes were directed, with a very serious expression, towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together.
<darcy-actions> Darcy, recovering himself shortly, turned to his partner.
<darcy-actions> In Darcy's breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling toward Elizabeth, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy's astonishment at being so addressed was very evident.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy was eyeing Mr. Collins with unrestrained wonder.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy replied with an air of distant civility.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of Mr. Collins’ second speech.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy made Mr. Collins a slight bow, and moved another way.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with Mr. Collins' attention.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy sat opposite to them, overhearing Mrs. Bennet's impertinent words.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy's attention was invariably fixed by Mrs. Bennet's impertinent commentary.
<darcy-actions> The expression of Mr. Darcy's face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy continued impenetrably grave.
<darcy-actions> Though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, Mr. Darcy never came near enough to speak.
<darcy-actions> Darcy said nothing at all.
<darcy-actions> The united efforts of Bingley's two unfeeling sisters, and of his overpowering friend Mr. Darcy, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy’s house was where Bingley stayed.
<darcy-actions> Caroline wrote also with great pleasure of her brother’s being an inmate of Mr. Darcy’s house, and mentioned with raptures some Darcy's plans with regard to new furniture.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy’s actions attempted to lead Bingley away from his affection for Jane.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy’s influence was seen as a key factor in Bingley’s behavior.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy would not suffer Bingley to call on Jane during her stay in London.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs. Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend, met her with every appearance of composure.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy sat for some time without speaking to anybody.
<darcy-actions> His civility was awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family.
<darcy-actions> She thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet in London.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt’s ill-breeding, and made no answer.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister’s proficiency.
<darcy-actions> Elizabeth and Colonel Fitzwilliam conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy moved with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte, stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer’s countenance.
<darcy-actions> He smiled as he spoke to Elizabeth.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy paid the parsonage a visit on his own, after Elizabeth's cheeky suggestion to practice the art of conversation.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy seemed astonished on finding her alone.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy apologized for his intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth sat down.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy took the hint and soon began the conversation.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards Elizabeth.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and glanced over it.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy sat without saying much to anybody before leaving.
<darcy-actions> Darcy engaged in a short conversation, pleasantries about the local area.
<darcy-actions> Darcy appeared often at the parsonage.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy frequently sat at the Parsonage ten minutes together without opening his lips.
<darcy-actions> More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy.
<darcy-actions> It struck her in the course of their third encounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s happiness.
<darcy-actions> In speaking of Rosings, and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there too.
<darcy-actions> He actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy was concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy had ruined, for a while, every hope of happiness for Jane.
<darcy-actions> Elizabeth was surprised when she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room.
<darcy-actions> In a hurried manner, Mr. Darcy immediately began an inquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.
<darcy-actions> He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up, walked about the room.
<darcy-actions> After a silence of several minutes, Mr. Darcy came towards her in an agitated manner.
<darcy-actions> He caught Elizabeth's refusal with surprise and resentment.
<darcy-actions> His complexion became pale with anger, the disturbance of his mind visible in every feature.
<darcy-actions> He struggled for the appearance of composure, not opening his lips until he believed himself to have attained it.
<darcy-actions> He spoke with a voice of forced calmness.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy expressed his hope that his attachment would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand.
<darcy-actions> He spoke of his apprehension and anxiety in approaching Elizabeth to propose.
<darcy-actions> He caught Elizabeth's refusal with surprise and resentment.
<darcy-actions> His complexion became pale with anger, the disturbance of his mind visible in every feature.
<darcy-actions> He struggled for the appearance of composure, not opening his lips until he believed himself to have attained it.
<darcy-actions> He spoke with a voice of forced calmness.
<darcy-actions> He leant on the mantel-piece.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy changed colour.
<darcy-actions> He listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued.
<darcy-actions> He looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.
<darcy-actions> Darcy walked with quick steps across the room.
<darcy-actions> He hastily left the room.
<darcy-actions> Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy stepped forward with eagerness.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy held out a letter, which Elizabeth instinctively took.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy writes in a close hand.
<darcy-actions> Darcy wrote his letter to Elizabeth covering two sheets of letter paper.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy gave Elizabeth a letter.
<darcy-actions> He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied Elizabeth; his style seemed at first not penitent, but haughty.
<darcy-actions> He provided an account of his objections to the match between Jane and Bingley.
<darcy-actions> He detailed his history with Mr. Wickham, including Wickham’s dealings with the Pemberley family and the matter of the living.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy had called only for a few minutes to take leave.
<darcy-actions> Darcy left Rosings the day after giving Elizabeth his letter
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy has not authorized the communication of his sister’s affairs.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy's letter was not to be disclosed to others.
<darcy-actions> Elizabeth stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.
<darcy-actions> Elizabeth thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables.
<darcy-actions> He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise.
<darcy-actions> He shortly recovered himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth.
<darcy-actions> He provided his compliments to Elizabeth, though she had turned away instinctively in embarassment.
<darcy-actions> At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and after standing a few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy approached them, and at no great distance.
<darcy-actions> He was immediately before them after a turning in the walk.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy had lost none of his recent civility.
<darcy-actions> He asked Elizabeth if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.
<darcy-actions> He sustained his surprise with fortitude and did not leave, but turned back with them and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner.
<darcy-actions> He invited Mr. Gardiner to fish there as often as he chose, offering to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out the best parts of the stream for sport.
<darcy-actions> He acknowledged the truth of Mrs. Gardiner’s statement regarding his arrival and explained that business with his steward had caused him to come earlier than expected.
<darcy-actions> He mentioned that his party would join him early the next day, and among them were Mr. Bingley and his sisters.
<darcy-actions> He offered to introduce his sister to Mrs. Gardiner’s acquaintance during their stay at Lambton.
<darcy-actions> Darcy asked Elizabeth to walk into the house, but she declared herself not tired, so they stood together on the lawn.
<darcy-actions> Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage when it was time to depart.
<darcy-actions> Darcy walked slowly towards the house after the Gardner's carriage drove off.
<darcy-actions> Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and the introduction took place.
<darcy-actions> Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her.
<darcy-actions> Darcy asked her whether all her sisters were at Longbourn.
<darcy-actions> Darcy sought the acquaintance and courted the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace.
<darcy-actions> Darcy appeared civil, not only to Elizabeth, but to her very relations whom he had openly disdained.
<darcy-actions> It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far removed from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy discharged many of Wickham's debts.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy seemed eager to preserve the acquaintance with Elizabeth, soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister.
<darcy-actions> Darcy entered the room after being with Mr. Gardiner and other gentlemen by the river.
<darcy-actions> Darcy was earnestly looking at Elizabeth while she spoke, with a heightened complexion.
<darcy-actions> Darcy was concerned about his sister’s welfare and attempted to manage the situation with Elizabeth.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage.
<darcy-actions> Darcy returned to the saloon.
<darcy-actions> Darcy contented himself with coolly replying.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy’s judgment could not err; and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable.
<darcy-actions> Darcy was resolutely silent, however, and, from a determination of making him speak, Miss Bingley continued.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy appeared as Elizabeth reached the door.
<darcy-actions> Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start.
<darcy-actions> Before he could recover himself enough to speak, Elizabeth hastily exclaimed her need to leave.
<darcy-actions> Darcy, seeing Elizabeth’s distress, responded with more feeling than politeness.
<darcy-actions> He quickly recollected himself and offered assistance, suggesting that he or a servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner.
<darcy-actions> Seeing Elizabeth looking miserably ill, he found it impossible to leave her.
<darcy-actions> He spoke in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, offering to call her maid or bring her a glass of wine.
<darcy-actions> Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern and observe Elizabeth in compassionate silence.
<darcy-actions> Darcy was fixed in astonishment upon hearing the news of Lydia’s elopement.
<darcy-actions> Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.
<darcy-actions> Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her.
<darcy-actions> He was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air gloomy.
<darcy-actions> Darcy readily assured Elizabeth of his secrecy.
<darcy-actions> He again expressed his sorrow for her distress.
<darcy-actions> He wished for a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope.
<darcy-actions> He left his compliments for her relations.
<darcy-actions> With only one serious parting look, he went away.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy had been at Lydia's wedding.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy called and was shut up with Mr. Gardiner for several hours.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where Lydia and Mr. Wickham were and had seen them both.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy had something to direct his search and resolved to follow Mr. Gardiner.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy went to Mrs. Younge for intelligence about Wickham and, after a few days, obtained the information.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy insisted on seeing Lydia after seeing Wickham.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy asked Lydia to leave her disgraceful situation and return to her friends, offering his assistance.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy asked Mr. Gardiner why Wickham did not marry Lydia at once.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy purchased Wickham’s commission.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy returned to his friends after the arrangements were resolved and agreed to be in London for the wedding.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return and attended the wedding.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy dined with Mr. Gardiner's family the next day and was to leave town a few days later.
<darcy-actions> He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world.
<darcy-actions> I thought him very sly; he hardly ever mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research.
<darcy-actions> He was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce.
<darcy-actions> Darcy introduced Elizabeth to his sister.
<darcy-actions> Elizabeth had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at Pemberley.
<darcy-actions> Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, said scarcely anything.
<darcy-actions> He was not seated by her: perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire.
<darcy-actions> Several minutes elapsed, without bringing the sound of his voice.
<darcy-actions> When occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground.
<darcy-actions> More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when they last met, were plainly expressed.
<darcy-actions> After Bingley finished his visit, Darcy left with him.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy was almost as far from Elizabeth as the table could divide them.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy was on one side of her mother, and they spoke seldom to each other.
<darcy-actions> Their manner was formal and cold whenever Mr. Darcy and her mother spoke to each other.
<darcy-actions> Darcy had walked away to another part of the room.
<darcy-actions> Darcy brought back his coffee-cup himself.
<darcy-actions> Darcy stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence.
<darcy-actions> Darcy walked away when the young lady whispered to Elizabeth again.
<darcy-actions> Darcy was seated with the rest of the party.
<darcy-actions> Darcy held his secrecy. His aunt knows nothing of his involvement in Lydia's elopement.
<darcy-actions> Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out.
<darcy-actions> Very little was said by either; Darcy was likely preoccupied or silent during the walk.
<darcy-actions> Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy entertained each other while walking.
<darcy-actions> Elizabeth went boldly on with Darcy alone after Kitty left them.
<darcy-actions> Darcy replied in a tone of surprise and emotion at discovering Elizabeth knew of his having found Wickham and Lydia.
<darcy-actions> Darcy did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted with his secret.
<darcy-actions> Darcy acknowledged that his actions were influenced by the desire to give happiness to Elizabeth.
<darcy-actions> He expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do.
<darcy-actions> He told her of feelings which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable.
<darcy-actions> Elizabeth soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter, which, in her Ladyship’s apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance. This caused Darcy's return.
<darcy-actions> Mr. Darcy believed the letter to be written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.
<darcy-actions> Darcy believed himself to have been selfish all his life, though not in principle.
<darcy-actions> Darcy admitted that his parents allowed, encouraged, and even taught him to be selfish and overbearing.
<darcy-actions> Darcy acknowledged that he came to Elizabeth without a doubt of his reception.
<darcy-actions> Darcy thought he might still have been selfish had it not been for Elizabeth.
<darcy-actions> Darcy believed his vanity led him to think Elizabeth was wishing for or expecting his addresses.
<darcy-actions> He then told her of Georgiana’s delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn.
<darcy-actions> Darcy's gravity and thoughtfulness had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.
<darcy-actions> Darcy continued the conversation till they reached the house.
<darcy-actions> In the hall, Darcy parted from Elizabeth.
<darcy-actions> Darcy was delighted with Jane and Bingley's engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it.
<darcy-actions> Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth.
<darcy-actions> Darcy arrived again with Bingley on the day after his engagement to Elizabeth.
<darcy-actions> Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, in order to see Elizabeth alone.
<darcy-actions> Darcy rose and followed Mr. Bennet to the library.
<darcy-actions> Darcy appeared again and smiled at Elizabeth, slightly relieving her agitation.
<darcy-actions> Darcy approached the table where Elizabeth was sitting with Kitty, pretending to admire her work.
<darcy-actions> Darcy voluntarily helped Lydia by paying the debts and securing the commission.
<darcy-actions> Darcy returned to Netherfield to advise his friend to marry Jane, if he perceived her regard was undiminished
<darcy-actions> Darcy returned to Netherfield primarily with the object of seeing Elizabeth.
<darcy-actions> Darcy writes a letter to his aunt, informing her of his engagement.
<darcy-actions> He bore Mrs. Bennet's behavior with admirable calmness.
<darcy-actions> He could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James’s, with very decent composure.
<darcy-actions> If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.
<darcy-actions> Mrs. Philips’s vulgarity was another, and, perhaps, a greater tax on his forbearance.
<darcy-actions> Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification.
<darcy-actions> Darcy assisted Wickham further in his profession for Elizabeth’s sake.
<darcy-actions> Darcy had hoped to see the attachment of Elizabeth to his sister.
<darcy-actions> Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved the Gardiners.
