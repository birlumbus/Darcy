My dear Mr. Bennet,
But it is,
Do not you want to know who has taken it?
_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.
He came down to see the place
What is his name?
Bingley.
Is he married or single?
How so? how can it affect them?
My dear Mr. Bennet,
Is that his design in settling here?
In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.
It is more than I engage for, I assure you.
They have none of them much to recommend them,
Ah, you do not know what I suffer.
I hope Mr. Bingley will like it
I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.
We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,
since we are not to visit.
But you forget, mamma,
No more have I,
Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,
I do not cough for my own amusement,
To-morrow fortnight.
Ay, so it is,
What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?
While Mary is adjusting her ideas,
I am sick of Mr. Bingley,
Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,
What an excellent father you have, girls,
Oh,
I’m the tallest
He rode a black horse
If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,
When the Party entered
Come, Darcy,
I would not be so fastidious as you are,
_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,
She is tolerable
Which do you mean?
Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,
If he had had any compassion for _me_,
Oh, my dear,
But I can assure you,
He is just what a young-man ought to be,
He is also handsome,
Dear Lizzy!
_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,
_You_ were Mr. Bingley’s first choice.
Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.
_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,
Without once opening his lips
Are you quite sure, ma’am? Is not there a little mistake?
I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.
Miss Bingley told me,
I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,
Another time, Lizzy,
I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.
His pride,
That is very true,
Pride,
If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,
Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,
It may, perhaps, be pleasant,
Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you do.
Your plan is a good one,
Well,
What does Mr. Darcy mean,
That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.
The entreaties of several
You are severe on us.
It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,
Very well; if it must be so, it must.
Your friend performs delightfully,
You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.
Never, sir.
Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?
It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.
You have a house in town, I conclude?
Mr. Darcy is all politeness,
I can guess the subject of your reverie.
I should imagine not.
Miss Elizabeth Bennet.
Miss Elizabeth Bennet!
A note for Miss Bennet
I am astonished, my dear,
If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.
Yes; but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.
Mamma,
It is from Miss Bingley,
CAROLINE BINGLEY.
With the officers!
Dining out,
that is very unlucky.
Can I have the carriage?
That would be a good scheme,
I had much rather go in the coach.
They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.
But if you have got them to-day,
This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!
Yours, etc.
Well, my dear,
How can you be so silly,
I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.
Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,
I admire the activity of your benevolence,
We will go as far as Meryton with you,
If we make haste,
The Apothecary came
covering a screen
Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,
_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,
Certainly not.
It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,
I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,
Not at all,
they were brightened by the exercise.
Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.
That is capital,
If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,
Do you prefer reading to cards?
that is rather singular.
Miss Eliza Bennet,
I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,
In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,
I am astonished,
It ought to be good,
I wish it may.
With all my heart: I will buy Pemberley itself, if Darcy will sell it.
I am talking of possibilities, Charles.
Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?
It is amazing to me,
All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?
Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,
Nor I, I am sure,
Then,
Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.
Oh, certainly,
All this she must possess,
Eliza Bennet,
Undoubtedly,
Indeed I have, sir,
Removed!
You may depend upon it, madam,
I am sure,
Whatever I do is done in a hurry,
That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,
You begin to comprehend me, do you?
Oh yes--I understand you perfectly.
Lizzy,
I did not know before,
The country,
Yes, indeed,
When I am in the country,
Indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,
Did Charlotte dine with you?
She seems a very pleasant young woman,
And so ended his affection,
I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,
How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!
You write uncommonly fast.
You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.
It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.
Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.
I have already told her so once, by your desire.
Thank you--but I always mend my own.
How can you contrive to write so even?
That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,
My style of writing is very different from yours.
Oh,
Your humility, Mr. Bingley,
must disarm reproof.
Nothing is more deceitful,
And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?
Nay,
You have only proved by this,
I am exceedingly gratified,
By all means,
I see your design, Bingley,
What you ask,
Oh,
Indeed I do not dare.
I hope,
No, no; stay where you are
Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?
I did not know that you intended to walk,
You used us abominably ill,
Piling up the fire
very glad;
If you mean Darcy,
I should like balls infinitely better,
Not at all,
I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,
Oh, shocking!
Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,
Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!
Miss Bingley,
Certainly,
Such as vanity and pride.
Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,
and pray what is the result?
No,
_That_ is a failing, indeed!
And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate everybody.
And yours,
Do let us have a little music,
I hope, my dear,
The person of whom I speak is a gentleman and a stranger.
It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,
Oh, my dear,
It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,
WILLIAM COLLINS.
At four o’clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,
Though it is difficult,
He must be an oddity, I think,
In point of composition,
You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.
That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,
I think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?
Ah,
You judge very properly,
Fordyce’s Sermons.
The officers of the ----shire
I know little of the game at present,
About a month,
Yes,
As much as I ever wish to be,
I have no right to give _my_ opinion,
I cannot pretend to be sorry,
I wonder,
It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,
Indeed!
Good heavens!
This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.
But what,
I will not trust myself on the subject,
How strange!
It _is_ wonderful,
Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?
What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?
Not at all.
I know very well, madam,
Lady Catherine de Bourgh,
Mr. Collins,
I believe her to be both in a great degree,
delighted to see their dear friend again
They have both,
I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think.
While I can have my mornings to myself,
I am by no means of opinion, I assure you,
I dare say you will find him very agreeable.
Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?
Both,
This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,
I must not decide on my own performance.
He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,
What think you of books?
The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?
Yes, always,
I am,
And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?
I hope not.
May I ask to what these questions tend?
Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,
I am trying to make it out.
And what is your success?
I can readily believe,
I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,
His guilt and his descent appear, by your account, to be the same,
I beg your pardon,
Excuse my interference; it was kindly meant.
Insolent girl!
I want to know,
No,
Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself.
No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.
I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,
I have found out,
You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?
apology,
Hunsford,
Lady Catherine de Bourgh.
I have no reason, I assure you,
If I,
to assure you in the most animated language
No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you will stay where you are.
You are too hasty, sir,
I am not now to learn,
Upon my word, sir,
Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,
Really, Mr. Collins,
You are uniformly charming!
But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,
Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,
Sir, you quite misunderstand me,
I have not the pleasure of understanding you,
Of what are you talking?
And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems a hopeless business.
Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.
Come here, child,
Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?
I have, sir.
Yes, or I will never see her again.
My dear,
they entered the breakfast room
Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,
Ay, there she comes,
Oh, Mr. Collins!
My dear madam,
I found,
Walked back with them
It is unlucky,
It is evident by this,
It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_.
Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?
Most willingly.
If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,
You must decide for yourself,
How can you talk so?
and I am more obliged to you than I can express.
So much love and eloquence
My dear madam,
My dear sir,
Engaged to Mr. Collins! my dear Charlotte, impossible!
I see what you are feeling,
undoubtedly;
Protested he must be entirely mistaken.
_Whenever she spoke in a low voice_
Indeed, Mr. Bennet,
What should not you mind?
I should not mind anything at all.
I leave it to yourself to determine,
You doubt me,
My dear Jane,
Nay,
I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,
And men take care that they should.
I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley’s conduct to design,
And do you impute it to either of those?
You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?
Yes, in conjunction with his friend.
Beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,
So, Lizzy,
True,
I do not blame Jane,
It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,
Offended two or three young ladies
An excellent consolation in its way,
I hope,
She will drop the acquaintance entirely.
Will you come and see me?
My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.
Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.
Elizabeth, you are not serious now.
As I did the other day,
_wished_ they might be happy.
I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.
_That_ you certainly shall.
And I have another favour to ask. Will you come and see me?
We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.
My father and Maria are to come to me in March,
My aunt,
I did not think Caroline in spirits,
Yours, etc.
On the Stairs
But, my dear Elizabeth,
She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.
Well,
Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.
We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us,
but perhaps, to the Lakes.
At the door
Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman, indeed,
and a most attentive neighbour.
In Conversation with the ladies
And is this all?
La! my dear,
I like her appearance,
I confess,
I am the less surprised at what has happened,
A little.
One of them does.
No, not at all.
What, none of you?
Not one.
My mother would have no objection, but my father hates London.
Has your governess left you?
We never had any governess.
Yes, ma’am, all.
Upon my word,
With three younger sisters grown up,
I am not one-and-twenty.
he never failed to inform them
The gentlemen accompanied him.
At Church
We were talking of music, madam,
I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,
I assure you, madam,
I shall not say that you are mistaken,
I am not afraid of you,
Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,
I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.
Perhaps,
Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?
I can answer your question,
I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,
My fingers,
Perfectly so, I thank you.
I should not be surprised,
Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife.
An easy distance do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.
Are you pleased with Kent?
Accompanied by their aunt
What can be the meaning of this?
On looking up
I did not know before that you ever walked this way.
I have been making the tour of the park,
No, I should have turned in a moment.
Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?
He likes to have his own way very well,
Is this,
meant for me?
No,
Oh yes,
What is it you mean?
You may depend upon my not mentioning it.
Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?
And what arts did he use to separate them?
He did not talk to me of his own arts,
I am thinking of what you have been telling me,
You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?
That is not an unnatural surmise,
There were some very strong objections against the lady,
To Jane herself,
I might as well inquire,
Can you deny that you have done it?
But it is not merely this affair,
You take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns,
His misfortunes!
And of your infliction,
And this,
Hearing herself called
FITZWILLIAM DARCY.
Meeting accidentally in Town
How despicably have I acted!
His parting obeisance
I am much obliged to your Ladyship for your kind invitation,
But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.
Dawson
My uncle is to send a servant for us.
The elevation of his feelings.
I know not, Miss Elizabeth,
They had forgotten to leave any message
But,
Good gracious!
A great many indeed,
And how much I shall have to conceal!
How nicely we are crammed in
Is not this nice? is not this an agreeable surprise?
And we mean to treat you all,
Are they, indeed?
Yes,
Now I have got some news for you,
And Mary King is safe!
She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.
But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,
How nicely we are crammed in!
I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.
Oh, Mary,
His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,
Indeed,
Blame you! Oh, no.
But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?
No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.
This will not do,
I do not know when I have been more shocked,
And then,
Well, Lizzy,
I am determined never to speak of it again
I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more.
Well, Lizzy,
No, nothing at all.
It was a subject which they could not mention before me.
When Colonel Miller’s regiment went away
Good Heaven! What is to become of us? What are we to do?
I am sure,
I am sure I shall break _mine_,
If one could but go to Brighton!
Oh yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable.
A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever.
And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,
I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,
If you were aware,
Already arisen!
Tenderly flirting
Nearly three weeks.
And you saw him frequently?
Yes, almost every day.
His manners are very different from his cousin’s.
Yes, very different; but I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance.
Indeed!
that he is improved in essentials.
Oh, no!
But it is fortunate,
But surely,
Conjecturing as to the date
And of this place,
but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.
And that,
I have heard much of your master’s fine person,
Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?
A little.
And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma’am?
Yes, very handsome.
And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?
Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?
Except,
when she goes to Ramsgate.
If your master would marry, you might see more of him.
Can this be Mr. Darcy?
His father was an excellent man,
He is the best landlord, and the best master,
In what an amiable light does this place him!
This fine account of him,
Perhaps we might be deceived.
That is not very likely; our authority was too good.
He is certainly a good brother,
And this is always the way with him,
delightful,
charming,
What will be his surprise,
for your housekeeper,
There is also one other person in the party,
He is perfectly well-behaved, polite, and unassuming,
There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,
To be sure, Lizzy,
But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,
From what we have seen of him,
To make herself agreeable to all
Engaged by the river
How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,
For my own part,
Yes,
Oh! where, where is my uncle?
Good God! what is the matter?
No, I thank you,
I have not an instant to lose
When I consider,
I am grieved, indeed,
And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?
What is all settled?
The first pleasing earnest of their welcome
I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,
Do you really think so?
Upon my word,
In the first place,
It does seem, and it is most shocking, indeed,
But you see that Jane,
And do you really know all this?
I do, indeed,
Not yet,
Is my father in town?
Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.
And have you heard from him often?
And my mother--how is she? How are you all?
But you--how are you?
If I had been able,
Do not give way to useless alarm,
Oh, my dear brother,
But not before they went to Brighton?
No, I believe not.
Perhaps it would have been better,
We acted with the best intentions.
He brought it with him for us to see.
LYDIA BENNET.
Oh, thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!
Oh, Jane,
She had better have stayed at home,
He meant, I believe,
To whom I have related the affair
I am, dear sir,
A gamester!
What! is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?
You must not be too severe upon yourself,
Do you suppose them to be in London?
Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?
And Lydia used to want to go to London,
She is happy, then,
This is a parade,
I am not going to run away, papa,
Well, well,
What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.
Dear madam,
Oh, papa, what news? what news? have you heard from my uncle?
Yes, I have had a letter from him by express.
Well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?
What is there of good to be expected?
but perhaps you would like to read it.
Read it aloud,
But perhaps you would like to read it
Then it is as I always hoped,
they are married!
EDW. GARDINER.
Is it possible?
Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him,
My dear father, I congratulate you.
And have you answered the letter?
No; but it must be done soon.
Oh! my dear father,
Let me write for you,
I dislike it very much,
but it must be done.
And--may I ask?
Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.
And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man.
Money! my uncle!
what do you mean, sir?
That is very true,
No,
And they are really to be married!
I comfort myself with thinking,
If we are ever able to learn what Wickham’s debts have been,
We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,
Their conduct has been such,
Just as you please.
May we take my uncle’s letter to read to her?
Take whatever you like, and get away.
My dear, dear Lydia!
For we must attribute this happy conclusion,
Well,
I will go to Meryton,
The spiteful old ladies
Haye Park might do,
It was greatly my wish that he should do so,
E. GARDINER.
She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,
With an affectionate smile
Only think of its being three months,
Mrs. Wickham
Well, mamma,
I should like it beyond anything!
I thank you for my share of the favour,
No, really,
Mr. Darcy!
If it was to be a secret,
Oh, certainly,
Thank you,
You may readily comprehend,
Not that I _shall_, though,
I am sure she did not listen.
M. GARDINER.
I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?
You certainly do,
True. Are the others coming out?
Yes, she did.
And what did she say?
Certainly,
Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,
Yes; he introduced us to his sister.
And do you like her?
Very much.
I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.
Did you go by the village of Kympton?
I do not recollect that we did.
How should you have liked making sermons?
Mr. Darcy with him.
Oh, my dear Lydia,
when shall we meet again?
Oh, Lord! I don’t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.
Write to me very often, my dear.
He is as fine a fellow,
I often think,
This is the consequence, you see, madam, of marrying a daughter,
Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,
You may depend on it,
Yet it is hard,
As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,
’Tis an _etiquette_ I despise,
I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,
I wish I could say anything to comfort you,
There is a gentleman with him, mamma,
who can it be?
La!
Let me first see how he behaves,
Could I expect it to be otherwise?
Yet why did he come?
It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,
It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,
When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,
The first wish of my heart,
You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,
Jane happened to look round
Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,
did he come at all?
Now,
Yes, very indifferent, indeed,
My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now.
If he does not come to me, _then_,
Is your sister at Pemberley still?
Yes; she will remain there till Christmas.
And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?
Well, girls,
M^{rs}. Long and her nieces.
It has been a very agreeable day,
You are very cruel,
Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak to you.
Next time you call,
I hope we shall be more lucky.
Can you come to-morrow?
We will be down as soon as we can,
Nothing, child, nothing. I did not wink at you.
Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,
Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.
We may as well leave them by themselves, you know,
’Tis too much!
I must go instantly to my mother,
And this,
Where is your sister?
With my mother upstairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.
Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.
You are a good girl,
Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,
He has made me so happy,
I suspected as much,
That is the most unforgiving speech,
I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!
And _that_, I suppose, is one of your sisters?
Yes, madam,
You have a very small park here,
Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.
Go, my dear,
After a short survey
How could I ever think her like her nephew?
Miss Bennet,
If you believed it impossible to be true,
At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.
Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,
I never heard that it was.
And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?
Your Ladyship has declared it to be impossible.
If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.
These are heavy misfortunes,
Whatever my connections may be,
Tell me, once for all, are you engaged to him?
I am not.
And will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement?
I will make no promise of the kind.
You can _now_ have nothing further to say,
Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.
You are then resolved to have him?
Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,
She did not choose it,
she would go.
But now it comes out
Lizzy,
I was going to look for you: come into my room.
From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?
Are you not diverted?
Oh, yes. Pray read on.
Oh,
The efforts of his aunt
I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,
If you _will_ thank me,
It taught me to hope,
Did it,
I knew,
When I wrote that letter,
Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?
No, indeed, I felt nothing but surprise.
My object _then_,
What could have become of Mr. Bingley and Jane?
I must ask whether you were surprised?
Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.
That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.
On the evening before my going to London,
Did you speak from your own observation,
Unable to utter a syllable
My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?
Good heaven! can it be really so? Yet now I must believe you,
What do you mean?
Now I am quite happy,
Good gracious!
I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,
It may do very well for the others,
Lizzy,
Have you any other objection,
I do, I do like him,
Lizzy,
Well, my dear,
My dearest child,
I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,
The obsequious civility.
For the liveliness of your mind I did.
Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.
But I was embarrassed.
And so was I.
You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.
A man who had felt less might.
Yours sincerely,
Yours,
